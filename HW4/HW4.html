        <p>You will make a program that uses a parametric curve to define an
          intricate trajectory, and use this representation both to draw such a curve as
          well as move/animate an object along it.</p>
          <p><b>Requirements:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Requirement #1.</b> Your drawing has to include, at minimum, one of the following:
            <ul><li>(a) A piecewise-defined curve, that shifts from one formula to another,
              that is also closed in the sense that the curve returns to the place where it started,
              forming a closed “loop”; note that this is different from the example we saw in class,
              where all curves, including those that had piecewise-definitions, were “open”</li>
            <li>(b) Multiple separate curves, out of which one has to have a piecewise-defined formula
              (i.e. at least two components with different formulas, joined together), but in this case
              the curves don’t have to be closed (unless you want them to be!).</li></ul>
          <li><b>Requirement #2.</b> Your drawing needs to have at least one object that is
            animated using one of the curves defined. It is sufficient to have the parametric
            curve control only the position of the moving object, but if you want to be extra fancy
            you can also control the orientation of the moving object.</li>
          <li><b>Requirement #3.</b> You must “draw” the path of at least one of the curves involved in your scene
            (consider the way we discussed in our demos, by splitting the curve up into small line segments).
            It’s ok to have a “switch” of sorts (e.g. the value of a slider) that “turns off” drawing the curve line,
            if you feel your scene looks better without it! As long as there is the option to display that path, you are good!</li>
          <li><b>Requirement #4.</b> At the point where the different formulas of a piecewise-defined curve in your scene,
            you must enforce at least C0-continuity (G1-continuity or higher would be nice; C2 might be overkill,
            but you are welcome to do it). This is just for one of the junctions in one of your piecewise-defined curves;
            you are free to use any degree of continuity for all other cases.</li>
          <li><b>Requirement #5.</b> At least one of the curves you use in your implementation has to be a
            parametric cubic (Hermite, Bezier, B-spline, etc). It doesn't have to be the case that all
            components of a piecewise curve will have to be a cubic ... just that somewhere in
            your scene there must be a curve that has at least one component (if it's a piecewise/component curve)
            that's a cubic. Frankly, you might find that one of the most natural ways to enforce C1 continuity
            (if you choose to have at least that degree of smoothness) is to resort to cubics anyhow ...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are welcome to use either sliders, or automatic animation to “move” your objects along any curve
          trajectories; use whatever feels best for your vision of the scene you want to create!</p>
