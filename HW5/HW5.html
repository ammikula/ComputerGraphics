        <p>What you are asked to do is to create a visualization similar to the
          “camera” view of this example (the window on the right) where we
          visualize what the camera “sees” from its vantage point.</p>
          <p><b>Requirements:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Requirement #1.</b> You must have a moveable camera. The motion
            can either be automatic, or triggered by manipulation of a slider.
            It is ok for the motion of the camera to be relatively simple
            (i.e. translation along a line, or motion along a curve).</li>
          <li><b>Requirement #2.</b> Your 3D world must include a hierarchical
            model, or a parametric curve (or both!).</li>
          <li><b>Requirement #3.</b> Your example should make it apparent that
            you are observing a 3D scene, as opposed to a 2D object. For
            example, if you drew everything in the 2D plane (just replacing
            every coordinate (x,y) with a triple (x,y,0) to “make it 3D”), and
            just translated the entire drawing up/down (to emulate “moving the
            camera”), this is really just a 2D drawing exercise, not something
            that feels like 3D. Having the camera “spin around” an object,
            having a 3D (non-planar) parametric curve, or having a 3D object
            are good possibilities for showing off the 3D nature of your
            program.</li>
          <li><b>Requirement #4.</b> You need to use a projection transform.
            It can be either orthographic or perspective.
            The aforementioned viewing demo has examples of both, implemented
            via glMatrix. </li>
