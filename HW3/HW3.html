        <ul>
          <li>In your previous programming assignment, you were asked to create a scene with one
            of more objects that are created according to the principles of hierarchical modeling.
            In creating such objects, you were asked to leverage the HTML5 Canvas transformation commands
            (i.e. the translate(), scale(), rotate() methods of the drawing context) and the stack
            supported within canvas (manipulated via the save(), restore() methods) to create models
            with multiple components whose transforms hierarchically depend on each other.</li>
          <li>This assignment, you are asked to implement any transforms using explicit matrix representations,
            using a matrix/vector library such as glMatrix (Links to an external site.) or
            TWGL (Links to an external site.) that we discussed in class. Although glMatrix
            would be gently recommended, since we had the opportunity to cover it in more detail in class,
            you are absolutely welcome to use TWGL or some other matrix library instead.</li>
          <li>One possible idea, if you are happy with the result you turned in for Programming Assignment #2
            would be to first create a version of the same product, that is visually identical to
            what you implemented using the Canvas transformation functionality, but internally
            substitute all the calls to the translate(), scale(), rotate() calls (or the save(),
            restore() methods for the built-in transform stack) with glMatrix transform representations
            and operations.</li>
