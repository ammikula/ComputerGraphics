        <p>The goal of this assignment is to have you figure out the programming
          aspects of drawing pictures on web pages using the JavaScript 2D Canvas library.
          You should create a new program (as a single HTML file, or even better a separate
          .html file and a .js file with the JavaScript code, as exemplified in the demos
          from the GitHub repository) that includes – at minimum – the following visual elements: </p>
        <i>
        <ul>
          <li>You should draw at least one filled shape (e.g. a polygon).</li>
          <li>You should either have multiple, separate filled shapes
            or draw some shapes that are not filled alongside the filled polygons,
            for example polygonal shapes that are only drawn as a line
            (if you do the latter, make sure that this shape includes more than one line segment).
            You are welcome to do both, of course, and include multiple filled shapes
            and multiple line-drawn (non-filled strokes) along them!</li>
          <li>You must demonstrate the use of more than one color in your drawing.</li>
          <li>You must include at least one slider in your program, and have it affect
            the image drawn in some way. For example, it could control the location
            of one of the polygon vertices being drawn; or it could control the
            thickness of some line; or it could move an entire shape.</li>
        </ul>
        </i>
        <p>The requirements above are what is asked of you to get a “Satisfactory”
          grade (i.e. a score of “3”) in the programming assignment.
          If you want to contend for an “above-and-beyond” grade (i.e. “4”),
          you should consider drawing something more elaborate.
          For example (not an exhaustive list) : </p>
        <i>
        <ul>
          <li>Something that creatively combines many shapes to create an interesting appearance.</li>
          <li>Something that changes shape (perhaps as triggered by the value of the slider) in an interesting way.</li>
          <li>Something that includes an animation (we will talk about options for that on the September 16th lecture).</li>
        </ul>
